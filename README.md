# ProofBoard

**ProofBoard** is a privacy-focused reputation layer for DAOs and online communities — powered by zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs).  
It enables users to prove their contributions (like voting, participation, or task completion) without revealing personal or wallet data.

---

## 🚧 Status

Currently in ideation and planning stage.  
Integration with **VLayer** is planned for scalable proof generation and lightweight verification infrastructure.

---

## 🔌 Planned Features

- ✅ Contribution-based proof system  
- ✅ DAO participation verification  
- ⚙️ VLayer ZK integration  
- 🧠 Identity abstraction layer  
- 📊 Frontend dashboard (React + tailwind)

---

## 🛠️ Stack (Proposed)

- VLayer (ZK infrastructure)  
- React + TypeScript  
- Ethers.js  
- Hardhat  
- IPFS (optional for storing off-chain metadata)
